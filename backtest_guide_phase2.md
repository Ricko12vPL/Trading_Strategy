# Backtest Guide Phase 2 - Advanced Validation & Implementation
## Comprehensive Risk Assessment and Deployment Checklist

### CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

This phase focuses on identifying and eliminating sources of false positives and ensuring robust strategy deployment. Even with low p-values and positive Monte Carlo results, multiple validation layers are mandatory before live deployment.

## üìä SECTION 3: SOURCES OF FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS

### 3.1 DATA-SNOOPING AND OVERFITTING DETECTION

**MANDATORY CHECKS:**
```
Data Snooping Assessment Checklist:
‚òê Record total number of parameter combinations tested

‚òê Apply Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction
‚òê Document selection process and reasoning
‚òê Verify strategy performance on completely unseen data
‚òê Test strategy on different asset classes/markets
‚òê Validate strategy logic makes fundamental sense
```

**OVERFITTING INDICATORS TO MONITOR:**
- Strategy performs perfectly on training data but poorly OOS
- Large number of parameters relative to data points

## ‚úÖ SECTION 4: PRE-DEPLOYMENT IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### 4.1 STATISTICAL CORRECTIONS AND MULTIPLE TESTING

**MANDATORY STATISTICAL ADJUSTMENTS:**
```
Multiple Testing Corrections:
‚òê Bonferroni Correction Implementation:
   - Œ±_corrected = Œ±_original / number_of_tests
   - Document all tests performed (parameter sweeps, lookback periods, etc.)
   - Record which strategies survive Bonferroni correction
   - Example: If tested 100 parameter combinations, Œ± = 0.05/100 = 0.0005
   
‚òê Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate:
   - Rank all p-values from smallest to largest
   - Find largest k where P(k) ‚â§ (k/m) √ó Œ±
   - Control false discovery rate at desired level (typically 0.05 or 0.10)
   - More powerful than Bonferroni for multiple strategies
   
‚òê Documentation Requirements:
   - Log all tested parameters and their performance
   - Record selection criteria and thresholds used
   - Document why specific parameters were chosen
   - Maintain audit trail of all decisions
```

   - Test window: 3-6 months
   - Step size: 1 month (monthly re-optimization)
   - Record performance degradation over time
   - Calculate stability metrics across walks
   
‚òê Rolling Window Validation:
   - Fixed window size (e.g., 5 years)
   - Roll window forward monthly/quarterly
   - Test parameter stability over time
   - Identify regime-dependent performance
   
‚òê Cross-Validation for Time Series:

   - Blocked cross-validation preserving temporal order
```

### 4.3 ROBUSTNESS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

**PARAMETER SENSITIVITY TESTING:**
```
Robustness Testing Protocol:
‚òê Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:

```

### 4.4 ADVANCED BOOTSTRAP AND MONTE CARLO METHODS

**SOPHISTICATED RESAMPLING TECHNIQUES:**

**Block size & frequency guidance (practical note):**
```
- For intraday data: consider block sizes equal to 1 trading day (all intraday bars within day) or 20-60 bars depending on bar resolution.
- For daily data: block size 20-60 days is reasonable to preserve monthly patterns; shorter blocks (5-20) may be used to preserve weekly structure.
- Choose block size based on:
  * Data resolution (tick/minute/daily),
  * Strategy holding period (intraday, multi-day, swing),
  * Observed autocorrelation length (use ACF/PACF to estimate).
- Always run sensitivity: test multiple block sizes (e.g., 20, 40, 60) and report stability of metrics.
```
**Why:** Block size critically affects bootstrap fidelity; give concrete guidance so users adapt by freq.
```
Advanced Bootstrap Methods:
‚òê Stationary Block Bootstrap:
   - Block size: 20-60 observations (preserve monthly patterns)
   - Number of bootstrap samples: 10,000+
   - Calculate bootstrap confidence intervals
   - Test significance of performance metrics
   
‚òê Circular Block Bootstrap:
   - Handles edge effects better than standard block bootstrap
   - Preserves seasonal patterns and trends
   - More accurate for long-term dependencies
   
‚òê Model-Based Bootstrap:
   - Fit ARIMA-GARCH to residuals
   - Generate synthetic return series
   - Preserve volatility clustering and fat tails
   - Test strategy on model-generated scenarios
   
‚òê Wild Bootstrap:
   - Robust to heteroskedasticity
   - Maintains original data points
   - Good for non-stationary time series
   - Less assumption-dependent
```

### 4.5 REALISTIC COST AND CAPACITY MODELING

**COMPREHENSIVE COST ANALYSIS:**
```
Real-World Cost Modeling:
‚òê Conservative Cost Scenario (Recommended for Initial Sizing):
   - Slippage: 0.10-0.20% per trade
   - Market impact: 0.05-0.15% for moderate size
   - Bid-ask spread: Full spread cost
   - Commission: $1-5 per trade plus SEC fees
   - Financing: Prime + 2-4% on margin
   
‚òê Realistic Cost Scenario (Normal Operations):
   - Slippage: 0.05-0.10% per trade
   - Market impact: 0.02-0.08% for appropriate sizing
   - Bid-ask spread: 50-75% of spread
   - Commission: Negotiated rates
   - Financing: Prime + 1-2% on margin
   
‚òê Aggressive Cost Scenario (Best Case):
   - Slippage: 0.02-0.05% per trade
   - Market impact: 0.01-0.03% for small size
   - Bid-ask spread: 25-50% of spread
   - Commission: Volume discounts
   - Financing: Prime + 0.5-1% on margin
   
‚òê Capacity Analysis:
   - Maximum position size without market impact
   - Daily volume constraints (max 10% of ADV)
   - Liquidity during stress periods
   - Scaling limitations as AUM grows
```

### 4.6 LIQUIDITY AND CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS

**POSITION SIZING AND LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS:**
```
Liquidity Assessment:
‚òê Average Daily Volume Analysis:
   - TQQQ: ~$2-5B daily volume ‚Üí Max position ~$50-200M
   - SQQQ: ~$500M-2B daily volume ‚Üí Max position ~$10-50M
   - Individual stocks: Max 5-10% of 20-day ADV
   - Options: Much more restrictive, especially for illiquid strikes
   
‚òê Market Impact Modeling:
   - Square root law: Impact ‚àù ‚àö(trade_size/volume)
   - Temporary impact: 0.1 to 1.0% depending on urgency
   - Permanent impact: 0.01 to 0.10% for large trades
   - Non-linear scaling for very large positions
   
‚òê Stress Liquidity Testing:
   - Liquidity during 2008, 2020 crisis periods
   - After-hours and pre-market liquidity
   - Earnings announcement periods
   - FOMC and major news event liquidity
   - Market closure risk (circuit breakers)
```

### 4.7 PAPER TRADING AND LIVE SIMULATION

**LIVE MARKET VALIDATION:**
```
Paper Trading Protocol:
‚òê Live Market Simulation:
   - Use real-time market data feeds
   - Implement actual order routing
   - Test during different market hours
   - Include pre-market and after-hours sessions
   - Simulate partial fills and order rejections
   
‚òê Order Management System Testing:
   - Test limit orders, market orders, stop orders
   - Validate order modification and cancellation
   - Test during high volatility periods
   - Verify risk management controls
   - Test position sizing calculations
   
‚òê Data Feed Reliability:
   - Test with primary and backup data sources
   - Handle data feed outages and reconnections
   - Validate data quality and timeliness
   - Test with different data vendors
   - Monitor for data anomalies and bad ticks
   
‚òê Performance Tracking:
   - Compare paper trading results to backtest
   - Track slippage and execution quality
   - Monitor latency and fill rates
   - Document any performance degradation
   - Run for minimum 3-6 months before live deployment

**Paper Trading Minimum Requirements (frequency-aware)**:
```
Paper Trading Minimums (choose whichever is met first):
‚òê Intraday / High-frequency strategies (>=5 trades/day): min 1-2 months OR min 1000 filled trades
‚òê Daily / Mid-frequency strategies (>=1 trade/day to <5/day): min 3 months OR min 300 filled trades
‚òê Low-frequency strategies (<1 trade/day): min 3-6 months AND min 100-200 filled trades
‚òê General rule: require BOTH a minimum time window and a minimum number of real filled trades to ensure statistical significance.
‚òê If using options/futures with low trade rate, require longer observation (6+ months) or higher trade counts (200+ fills).
```
**Why:** Time-only thresholds can be misleading for low-frequency strategies ‚Äî using both time and trade-count ensures results are meaningful.
```

### 4.9 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

**COMPREHENSIVE RISK CONTROLS:**

### Model revalidation and retraining policy
```
- Scheduled revalidation: run full validation (subset of tests: robustness, rollback, MC) quarterly (every 3 months).
- Triggered revalidation: trigger immediate revalidation if:
  - Realized P&L drops > 20% vs expected over rolling 60 trading days, OR
  - Realized Sharpe falls > 30% vs expected, OR
  - Drawdown exceeds historical worst-case by > X% (configurable), OR
  - Significant change in market structure (e.g., volatility regime shift).
- Record results and decision (retrain / parameter adjust / pause / retire).
```
**Why:** Ensures strategy remains valid over time and adapts to regime shifts.
```
Risk Management Implementation:
‚òê Position-Level Risk Controls:
   - Maximum position size: 5-15% of portfolio per trade
   - Single-name concentration: Max 20% in any one security

   - Maximum drawdown limit: -15% to -25% (kill switch)
   - Daily loss limit: -3% to -5% of portfolio
   - Monthly loss limit: -8% to -12% of portfolio
   - Volatility targeting: Adjust position sizes for consistent risk
   - Correlation monitoring: Reduce positions if correlations spike
   
‚òê Dynamic Risk Adjustments:
   - VIX-based position sizing (reduce size when VIX > 30)
   - Market regime detection and adjustment
   - Trailing stop losses for profitable positions
   - Profit taking rules: Take partial profits at +20%, +50%
   - Position scaling: Increase winners, reduce losers
