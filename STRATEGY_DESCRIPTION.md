## üé™ SIGNAL GENERATION METHODOLOGY

### Multi-Factor Technical Framework

**Primary Indicators (Applied Per Instrument):**

#### 1. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
**Calculation:** 14-period RSI with instrument-specific thresholds
```
Oversold Conditions (BUY Signals):
- Standard: RSI < 30
- Aggressive (EWG, FXI): RSI < 25  
- Conservative (TSLA): RSI < 20
- Very Conservative (AVGO, NVDA): RSI < 30

Overbought Conditions (SELL Signals):
- Standard: RSI > 70
- Aggressive (EWG, FXI): RSI > 75
- Conservative (TSLA): RSI > 80
- Very Conservative (AVGO, NVDA): RSI > 70
```

#### 2. Bollinger Bands Analysis
**Calculation:** 20-period moving average ¬± 2 standard deviations (instrument-adjusted)
```
Mean Reversion Signals:
- BUY: Price touches or breaks below lower Bollinger Band
- SELL: Price touches or breaks above upper Bollinger Band

Band Width Analysis:
- Squeeze Detection: Band width < 10% of middle band
- Expansion Signals: Increased volatility breakout confirmation

Instrument Adjustments:
- TSLA: 15-period, 2.5 std dev (wider bands for high volatility)
- NVDA: 15-period, 2.5 std dev (accommodate AI-driven volatility)
- Others: Standard 20-period, 2.0 std dev
```

#### 3. Volume Surge Analysis
**Calculation:** Current volume vs. 20-period moving average
```
Volume Confirmation Thresholds:
- Standard: Volume > 1.5x average
- High-Vol Stocks (TSLA): Volume > 2.0x average
- International ETFs (EWG, FXI): Volume > 1.6-1.8x average
- Tech Stocks (NVDA, AVGO): Volume > 1.4-2.2x average

Volume + Price Momentum:
- BUY Confirmation: Volume surge + positive momentum
- SELL Confirmation: Volume surge + negative momentum > -2%
```

#### 4. Momentum Analysis
**Calculation:** Price rate of change over multiple periods
```
Momentum Periods (Instrument-Optimized):
- Fast Momentum: 3-5 periods
  * TSLA, NVDA: 3-period (high-frequency response)
  * Others: 5-period (standard)
  
- Momentum Acceleration: 10-period moving average of momentum
- Divergence Detection: Price vs. momentum direction analysis

Signal Thresholds:
- Strong Positive: Momentum > +1.5% and above MA
- Strong Negative: Momentum < -1.5% and below MA
```

### Signal Combination Algorithm

**Multi-Factor Signal Synthesis:**
```
Signal Strength Calculation:
Base Score = 0

RSI Signals: ¬±1 point (oversold/overbought)
Bollinger Bands: ¬±1 point (mean reversion)
Volume Surge: ¬±1 point (confirmation)
Momentum: ¬±1 point (trend following)

Final Signal Determination:
- BUY Signal: Combined score ‚â• +2 AND confidence > 30%
- SELL Signal: Combined score ‚â§ -2 AND confidence > 30%
- HOLD: All other combinations
```

**Signal Confidence Weighting:**
```
Confidence = |Combined Score| / 4 * Risk Multiplier

Risk Multipliers by Tier:
- TIER 2 (High Confidence): 0.85-1.2
- TIER 3 (Speculative): 0.7-0.8

Minimum Trading Threshold: 30% confidence
```

## üíº POSITION SIZING & PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION

### Dynamic Position Sizing Framework

**Base Allocation Method:**
```
Target Position Size = Base Allocation √ó Signal Confidence √ó Risk Adjustment

Where:
- Base Allocation: Tier-based percentage (13% TIER2, 7.5% TIER3)
- Signal Confidence: 0.30-1.00 based on multi-factor strength
- Risk Adjustment: Instrument-specific multiplier (0.7-1.2)
```

**Kelly Criterion Integration:**
```
Enhanced Kelly Sizing:
1. Calculate historical win rate and average win/loss
2. Apply Kelly formula: f* = (bp - q) / b
3. Apply 25% Kelly fraction for conservative sizing
4. Cap at instrument maximum limits

Regime-Dependent Adjustments:
- High Volatility (VIX > 25): Reduce size by 20%
- Low Volatility (VIX < 15): Standard sizing
- Extreme Volatility (VIX > 40): Reduce size by 50%
```

**Position Limits (Institutional Risk Controls):**
```
Single Instrument Limits:
- Standard Maximum: 15% of total portfolio
- TSLA Limit: 12% (high volatility adjustment)
- NVDA/AVGO Limits: 8-10% (speculative tier)
- Minimum Position: $1,000 (execution efficiency)

Portfolio-Level Limits:
- Total Equity Exposure: 80% maximum
- Cash Reserve: 20% minimum
- Sector Concentration: 40% maximum per sector
- Geographic Concentration: 50% maximum per region
```
